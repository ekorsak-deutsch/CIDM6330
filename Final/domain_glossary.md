# Email Forwarding Rules Audit - Domain Glossary

This document defines the ubiquitous language used in the Email Forwarding Rules Audit system. It serves as a single source of truth for domain terminology, ensuring consistent understanding across technical and business stakeholders.

## Core Concepts

### Forwarding Rule

**Definition**: A configuration entry that redirects emails from one mailbox to another, potentially based on specific criteria.

**Attributes**:
- **Email**: The source email address for which the forwarding is configured
- **Name**: The name of the user who owns the email address
- **Forwarding Email**: The destination email address where messages are redirected
- **Has Forwarding Filters**: Indicates whether the rule uses criteria to selectively forward messages
- **Error**: Any error message associated with this rule
- **Investigation Note**: Security analyst's observations about this rule

**States**:
- **Under Review**: Currently being investigated by security team
- **Approved**: Verified as legitimate business use
- **Suspicious**: Potential security concern requiring further analysis
- **Malicious**: Confirmed unauthorized configuration

### Forwarding Filter

**Definition**: A set of criteria and actions that determine which emails are forwarded and how they are processed.

**Relationship**: Each Forwarding Rule can have exactly one Forwarding Filter configuration.

**Components**:
- **Criteria**: Conditions that must be met for an email to be forwarded
- **Action**: Instructions on what to do with emails matching the criteria
- **Created At**: When the filter was established

### Filter Criteria

**Definition**: Conditions used to determine which emails should be forwarded.

**Examples**:
- Sender email address matches a pattern
- Subject line contains specific keywords
- Message has attachments
- Message size exceeds a threshold
- Message is addressed to specific recipients

### Filter Action

**Definition**: Operations performed on emails that match the filter criteria.

**Examples**:
- Forward to specified email address
- Apply one or more labels
- Mark with priority flags
- Move to folder

## Investigation Process

### Audit

**Definition**: A systematic review of email forwarding rules to identify potential security risks.

### Investigation

**Definition**: The process of analyzing a forwarding rule to determine its legitimacy and risk level.

### Investigation Note

**Definition**: Documentation added by security analysts during review of forwarding rules, capturing observations and decisions.

### Disposition

**Definition**: The current status of a forwarding rule from a security perspective.

**Values**:
- **Not Malicious**: Confirmed legitimate business purpose
- **Under Investigation**: Currently being reviewed
- **Suspicious**: Requires additional scrutiny
- **Malicious**: Unauthorized configuration requiring remediation

## Reporting

### Report

**Definition**: A document generated by the system containing information about forwarding rules for compliance and security analysis.

**Types**:
- **Complete Report**: Comprehensive document containing statistics and full details of all rules and their filters
- **Statistics-Only Report**: Summary document with aggregate metrics about forwarding rules
- **Rules-Only Report**: Document listing all forwarding rules without their filter details

### Statistics

**Definition**: Aggregate metrics about forwarding rules in the system.

**Examples**:
- Total number of forwarding rules
- Number of rules with filters
- Distribution of rules by disposition
- Trends in rule creation over time

## Technical Concepts

### Repository

**Definition**: A pattern that abstracts the data access layer, providing collection-like access to domain objects.

### Celery Task

**Definition**: An asynchronous operation that runs in the background, such as generating reports.

### Message Broker

**Definition**: A system (Redis) that facilitates communication between the application and background workers.
